# TODO #

### Current projects

# Intersection policies #

- people are pausing a bit before they go in signal
- are people choosing lanes well?
- yield policy

- reservation protocol should actually be faster. opportunistic.
  - michael's refined notion of turn conflict
- unprotected left, right turn on red, better stop sign
- optimize fixpoints

# Zones #

- fix nondeterminism
- pathfinding totally breaks for some: perform_reroute's choice should be from router?
- benchmark

# Nouveau Congestion #

- test freq of updating / current router with 3 auditors
- reroute when something in route changes
- diffused/zone-based congestion metric
- live DTA... use latest link delays all the time, and dont bother with 2-tuple score.
  - put it in link auditor, just use normal a*, not even time dep.
  - how long does it take to cross a zone?
- mathvector as score for A* and related?

- tradeoffs and combos of things to do...
  - when to reroute?
  - base congestion: 80% of static, 50% of freeflow, ???
  - use real link delay or time/congestion system?
  - 3 types of congestion reporting
  - later: zones...

# Code cleanup #

- rename edges as lanes? policy -> controller? vertex -> junction? agent -> driver? behavior -> pilot?
  route -> navigator?
- hard to have multiple sims due to objects with state: Graph (norm coords), system wallets,
  AgentMap, ReplayDiffScheme, GUI
- reduce vars and publics and mutable collections
- distance/time types
- merge headless/gui clients

# Experiment framework #

- mode to run many things locally, in parallel
- port old experiments
- even record the parameters of the runs?
- revamp ModScenarioTool
- warm up period for measurements?

### Future projects

# Bugs #

- savestating
  - bad filenames when saving from a loaded savestate
  - resumable logging doesnt really work if they simulated past the savestate...

# Auctions #

- sysbids
  - doubles
  - tune
  - divide
  - new one to help people at the end of trip (since theyll leave the system)
- multiple bids for same item.. handle that
- system bid: bonus to reservation if i'll take the same time as somebody else
- better wallet than fair. (but its not only problem, fixed mode is also borked)

# Clown Car #

- change limit of never-toll from 3 to 5
- sticky congested/clear state.
- take into account time and cost simultaneously
- regular rerouting
- tolls justified thru fundamental diagram

# Debugging, info, etc #

- different measure of live vs moved agents. cumulative
- debugging useful: warn when turn not used for a while, and when agent caught in a long loop
- is it even valid to consider results from first/last agents? need steady-state.
- measure how long a vehicle spends thrashing about bc original path is congested

# Trip distribution #

- residence -> house
- repository of detailed cities with demand data?

# Traffic model simplification #

- dont mess with gps coords

# Hard realism #

- different agent params
  - modular agent behavior, like give up on LC vs slow down for it
- tune all params

# Tests #

- how?
- wacky cases of 2 side-by-side agents wanting to swap places?

# Performance: misc #

- possible optimization: store pred/succ for agents directly, dont rely on queue
- .view, .withFilter
- turn blocked invariant, really maintain it for efficiency!
  just look at the next guy. BUT we can be route-done, but have somebody blocking in front of us
  initially. so in that case, search forward?
  - this only happens because we join a queue without demanding invariants of stuff in front of us
- faster congestion rerouting idea: flood from current point, avoiding congestion, till we reach a
  road in our old path

# Performance: fastpaths #

- agents and intersections could wake each other up now

# Performance: parallelization #

- agent react() is fine except for events, maybe

# Map making #

- find all cases where you can enter a road from one lane only and not reach all succs from that lane (aka have to LC)
- not sure: if LC dist is > road dist, super problems
- min lengths should matter for lanes everywhere, not roads
- degenerate verts should have same num of lanes
- num of lanes bounded by num of times could LC
- floating vertices due to nuking all roads that lead up to it, and choosing
  the vert to keep poorly
- road artifacts should match number of lanes, visually capture entire area where agents turn
  - and not be there when orig road is removed
- handle cul de sacs once and for all... bernwood is example in BR. remove if
  only one other link?
- dont tie map filename to the serialized thing
- xml output too for non-aorta clients
- make turns better, more systematically
  - try to not remove pieces of maps at all
- use http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:restriction
- lots of things break in sim logic if we have a vertex with a self-loop

# 3D GUI: Base #

- make a thing to change some constants online...
- port all content things to lwjgl
- better overhead controls
- perspective camera
- 3D buildings

# UI #

- color intersections neutrally
- visualize red/green lights better
- visualize lookahead
- right click context menus
- show 'fps' in viewer
- side by side runs
